# Arcarde-RS

A toy project that is summoned to get acquainted with Rust language and it's ecosystem.


### CAUTION

On Windows, please make sure, that SDLx.dll is being placed at project root (the same directory Cargo.toml file is being placed in);
[Not Recommended] If SDL version is different from 2, then go to build.rs and modify the version of DLL to conform the version used.
Also, we need to set up SDL image 2.0. Installation process is similar to what we need to do with SDL itself.
